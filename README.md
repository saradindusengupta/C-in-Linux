# C-in-Linux
To eliminate all the hassle for the newcomers in Linux to compile a C program.
Add the "c.c" C text file in the \home folder
Open the terminal and type the following commands 
" gedit c.c"
then save and close the file
return to terminal and type this
"cc c.c -o gcc"
/*"gcc" being the file name that you may want to put. You can change the name upon your convenience*/
"./gcc"
and Voila

So next time when you have to compile any C programm just type "./gcc" in the terminal and run your programm.
